Preparing the Project and Creating Components
=========

Before beginning I made use of Mircosoft's documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/react?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio
to set up the CRA server to run seperately from the ASP.NET Core app. Doing so allows enables my ASP.NET Core app to start and restart faster, and the front-end no longer
has to rebuild with app each time.

The following was the content for this part of the series:

* Creating a New Project
* Third-Party Libraries
* React Components Overview
* Creating Our Components
* Home Component

I had to delete some files because I used VS's React template and it came with additional files. As the list aboce shows, this part was basic React and getting our feet wet.
